<section id="description3" class="rel-mt-2 rich-input-content" aria-label="Record description">
    <p>The Chinese remainder theorem gives the general solution of the 
      strongly constrained linear congruence system of module pairwise coprime, 
      but it can not directly give the minimum natural number solution of the 
      system of congruence equations. Nor does it clarify the necessary and 
      sufficient conditions for the weak constrained linear congruence 
      equations with different modules to have a solution and the formula of 
      weakly constrained general solution. Here, the Chinese remainder theorem 
      is promoted, clarifying the conditional equations for the existence of 
      solutions to weakly constrained systems of linear congruence equations. 
      The new concise formulas are utilized to express the general solutions 
      of strongly constrained congruence systems and weakly constrained 
      congruence systems, thereby improving the theory of system of congruence 
      equations. Then, the concise steps are provided to directly construct 
      the general solutions of linear strongly constrained and weakly 
      constrained system of congruence equations, in order to promote the 
      popularization of congruence equation theory on a wider range. Finally, 
      the question of whether a universal method for solving the rational 
      number solution of the minimum number of digits for an indefinite system 
      of equations exists was brought up.</p>

  <p>The spherical harmonic partial differential equation is usually solved by 
    variable separation. When the magnetic quantum number m of the obtained Legendre 
    spherical harmonic function is 0, the Legendre spherical harmonic function 
    degenerates into the Legendre function of angle θ. This is a deduction that may 
    seem rigorous in mathematics but is actually not true. Replace the cosine 
    function of angle θ in the Legendre function with the product of the sine 
    function of angle θ and the sine function or cosine function of angle φ, and 
    obtain two special binary trigonometric series called special entanglement 
    functions that satisfy the spherical harmonic partial differential equation. 
    According to the basic principles of differential equation, the linear 
    combination of three special spherical harmonic functions is a local special 
    general solution of the spherical harmonic partial differential equation with a 
    magnetic quantum number m of 0. However, the normalization condition cannot 
    determine the three undetermined coefficients and therefore cannot determine the 
    specific spherical harmonic function. The established physical conclusions based 
    on spherical harmonic functions, especially the mathematical principles of 
    quantum mechanics, need to supplement the definite solution conditions of 
    spherical harmonic partial differential equations and rewrite them after 
    determining specific exact solutions.</p>

<p>The textbook solutions of Schrödinger equations are usually represented as 
	the combination of multiple special function symbols, resulting in a large 
	number of missing exact solutions not being discovered. Taking the 
	Schrödinger wave function of a hydrogen atom as an example, regressing to 
	the analytical expression that can be extended and programmed for testing, 
	two types of special entangled wave functions that have not been described 
	by established theories have been discovered. Specifically, when the 
	magnetic quantum number is 0, the traditional Schrödinger wave function 
	degenerates into a binary function about radial variables r and angle θ 
	without angles φ. The conclusion of this reasoning process, which seems very 
	rigorous in the traditional sense, is actually extremely untrue. The 
	Schrödinger equation for hydrogen atoms has two types of special entangled 
	solutions with magnetic quantum numbers of 0, and the sine and cosine 
	functions of angle φ are included in it, implying that there are other 
	unknown wave functions that satisfy the Schrödinger equation and even affect 
	the energy eigenvalue formula. The three-dimensional function image of the 
	special entangled solution of the hydrogen atom Schrödinger equation is 
	further drawn. The results show intuitively and clearly that there is no 
	one-to-one correspondence between the zero or extreme point of the modulus 
	function of the ternary function and that of the square of the modulus 
	function of the ternary function. It is concluded that the definition of the 
	square of the wave function modulus as the probability density function 
	lacks causality, and it is an urgent problem to derive the probability 
	density function according to the basic principle.</p>

	<p class="style9">  <strong>PS: 
	Why do contemporary breakthrough papers choose to be 
	published in self media journals?  </strong>
	</p>
			<p class="style8">  This groundbreaking paper based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379640424_Dongfang_Special_Entangled_Spherical_Harmonic_Functions"><strong>Dongfang Special Entangled Spherical Harmonic Functions</strong></a> was written within a 
			week, aiming to reveal the serious confidence issues hidden in 
			quantum mechanics and promote significant changes in scientific 
			theory.</p>
			<p class="style8">  Before writing this paper, Nature Physics had 
			sent a solicitation letter to the author, mainly inquiring about the 
			author&#39;s recent research status, the title and abstract of the paper 
			the author plans to submit to Nature Physics, and the estimated time 
			required for the author to complete the research project. However, 
			based on the fact that breakthrough papers submitted to Nature 
			Physics in the past were all rejected, the author infers that Nature 
			Physics is not genuinely soliciting submissions from the author, but 
			is tentatively attempting to steal the core scientific principles 
			needed to create a new Newtonian era and achieve the plan of 
			revitalizing the country through science. The author did not reply 
			to this solicitation letter and deleted it as spam.</p>
			<p>  <span class="style8">After careful consideration, the author 
			decided to submit the new important paper to Nature Physics for the 
			last time, both to confirm his personal views on Nature and to 
			respond to readers&#39; doubts about the author&#39;s choice of publication 
			method. The article submission number is </span>

	<a href="https://mts-nphys.nature.com/cgi-bin/main.plex?el=A6Bj5YXy4A4CVNR5F4A9ftdObN9umCBYMpiIelzWal3vQZ" class="style9">
			<strong>NPHYS-2024-06-01859</strong></a></span><span class="style8">. 
			In the submitted version, the author removed important experimental 
			suggestions written after the first equation. The reason for doing 
			so is out of scientific belief and responsibility. The Nature 
			journal has an absolute advantage in enticing the world to submit 
			major breakthrough research results in a timely manner due to its 
			enormous influence. Editors can efficiently assist domestic 
			scientists in plagiarizing breakthrough discoveries that have 
			changed the scientific world. Although the Nature team and its 
			complex members, with their current level of scientific theory, do 
			not have the ability to perfect partial differential equation theory 
			and discover the fundamental principles of unified macroscopic and 
			microscopic quantum theory after plagiarizing special entanglement 
			function theory, if they shift their focus to plagiarizing 
			breakthrough experimental ideas, profound misunderstandings may 
			occur, leading science in a new wrong direction once again.</span></p>

			when submitting it to Nature Physics. After 18 days of detailed

			<p class="style8">  Readers should be aware of the reality of the 
			scientific world. On the one hand, because scientific theories play 
			a crucial role in the field of ideology, scientific research in many 
			countries is actually tied to political tasks. On the one hand, due 
			to the enormous benefits of scientific research, some individuals 
			who originally lacked the ability to conduct scientific research 
			actively infiltrate the editorial and peer review teams of renowned 
			academic journals, often plagiarizing and selling breakthrough 
			submissions to maximize their personal interests. In the field of 
			science, it usually takes a hundred or even hundreds of years for a 
			few pioneering researchers to emerge. If you are a pioneering 
			researcher, you will inevitably face numerous despicable opponents 
			everywhere, so never expect your breakthrough research results to be 
			accepted by reputable academic journals such as Nature. Instead, you 
			should consider how to publicly disclose your research results and 
			effectively do anti-theft and anti murder work, ensuring that great 
			discoveries are not contaminated by ignorant and unethical editors 
			or peer reviewers, and ensuring that readers with independent 
			research capabilities are timely informed of new discoveries and 
			develop theories correctly.</p><p class="style8">By reading numerous groundbreaking papers by authors, future pioneering researchers can also experience unique writing techniques that deter scientific thieves. However, there will always be just scientists in the world, which is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous progress of human civilization.&nbsp;</p>
