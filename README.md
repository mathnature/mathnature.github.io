As an independent scientific journal, Mathematics and Nature is dedicated to documenting epoch-making scientific breakthroughs that have been systematically suppressed by the traditional academic establishment. The current academic ecosystem is deeply entrenched in institutional corruption: to protect their vested interests, academic elites engage in the systemic suffocation of great new discoveries—employing tactics such as peer-review monopolization, resource blockade, and even outright theft of original work followed by defamation of the true discoverers.

Even more egregious is that when these academic gatekeepers fail to comprehend major breakthroughs, they weaponize their institutional power to systematically vilify the original innovators.

This journal, forged through bitter lessons, exposes a grim reality: modern academia has devolved into a self-serving arena where so-called "peer review" functions as a plagiarism laundering scheme for the establishment, and the "scientific community" has long degenerated into a cartel serving only to uphold authority. When discoveries akin to the laws of universal gravitation and electromagnetic induction emerge today, their pioneers are met not with acclaim, but with coordinated suppression by what masquerades as a scientific community but operates as an academic mafia. Without dismantling this institutionalized darkness, true scientific progress remains impossible.

We solemnly declare: Every revolutionary finding published in this journal stands as both a testament to human ingenuity and an indictment of academic malfeasance. These suppressed contributions will inevitably reshape the future of science, while the institutional persecution of their pioneers will stand as prima facie evidence in the historical reckoning of academic corruption. Only by fully exposing the criminal mechanisms of the academic oligarchy can science reclaim its essence—the pursuit of truth.
