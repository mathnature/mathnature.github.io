Readers often require authors to publish papers in mainstream journals. However, influential mainstream journals traditionally favoring established researchers have historically overlooked breakthrough discoveries by lesser-known scholars. Documented cases exist where key elements of innovative manuscripts appeared elsewhere prior to original authors' preprint publication, raising questions about editorial practices. These circumstances have necessitated independent platforms like Mathematics & Nature for disseminating novel findings. ï»¿ Mathematics & Nature serves as an independent venue for significant mathematical and scientific advances that challenge conventional paradigms. The journal will publish 100 studies re-examining foundational theories, including critical analyses of certain award-recognized works. Historical patterns indicate that Nobel selections have occasionally privileged theoretical frameworks later subject to substantive debate regarding their mathematical consistency and empirical support. This journal seeks to foster rigorous re-evaluation of such foundational scientific claims.
