    <p>The unitary principle is used to test the mathematical procedures and 
	conclusions of the standard theory of the Klein-Gordon equation in a Coulomb 
	field, and it is revealed that the exact solution of the Klein-Gordon 
	equation in a Coulomb field hides the inexorable wave function divergence 
	and virtual energy difficulty. The divergence was not found in the past 
	because it was concealed by an unnecessary function transformation 
	introduced in the process of solving differential equations. Since the 
	expected solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for a Coulomb field does not 
	meet the boundary conditions, but is only a pseudo solution, and there is no 
	other exact solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for the Coulomb field that 
	meets the expectation of energy quantization, which declares the end of the 
	Klein-Gordon equation for the Coulomb field. This conclusion is 
	irreversible. The Klein-Gordon equation is constructed by the evolution of 
	the operator of relativistic momentum energy equation. It is the foundation 
	equation of relativistic quantum force. The end of the desired solution 
	indicates that relativistic quantum mechanics and even relativistic 
	mechanics are facing severe challenges.<br>

  <p>The two-component radial wave function of the Dirac equation of hydrogen is 
	decomposed by linear combination function, which leads to the difference in 
	the range of energy eigenvalues of the new first-order differential 
	equations and the corresponding two simplified second-order differential 
	equations constrained by the same energy parameter, belonging to the 
	teratogenic simplified Dirac equation. The teratogenic simplification theory 
	of the Dirac equation of hydrogen atom introduces the term “decoupling”, 
	which is far from scientific logic, thus deleting a recursive relationship 
	or corresponding second-order differential equation whose eigenvalue set 
	does not meet the expectation, and only retaining the other one whose 
	eigenvalue set value meets the expectation. Such an obvious logic problem 
	has not been discovered or intentionally covered up, reflecting the real 
	background of modern physics. Here, we first use the machine proof method to 
	prove that the coefficient of the series solution of the teratogenic 
	simplified first-order Dirac equation system should satisfy the linear 
	recurrence relationship system without solution, which also proves that the 
	teratogenic simplified first-order Dirac equation system has no 
	eigensolution. Then the mathematical proof of the absence of solution of the 
	teratogenicity simplified first-order Dirac equation system is given from 
	different aspects. The simple truth is that the inconsistency of the 
	eigenvalues of the two teratogenic simplified second-order differential 
	equations destroys the existence and uniqueness theorem of the solutions of 
	the differential equations. The essence of decoupling is to intentionally 
	delete one of the two parallel second-order differential equations. The 
	methods and conclusions do not conform to the unitary principle. It is 
	concluded that the decoupled eigensolution of the teratogenic simplified 
	first-order Dirac equation is pseudo-solution. The teratogenic simplified 
	Dirac equation for the hydrogen-like atoms is therefore ended, and this 
	conclusion is irreversible.<br>

	<strong>13. Dongfang Solution of Induced Second Order Dirac Equations</strong></a></h2>
  <p>Solving the radial Dirac equation of the hydrogen atom, it usually follows 
	the treatment method of Schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom and 
	expresses the two-component wave function as two new variables divided by 
	the radial independent variables, thus transforming the equation into the 
	induced first-order Dirac equation system. According to the induced 
	first-order Dirac equations, two induced second order Dirac equations 
	constrained by the same energy parameter can be obtained. Here, I study the 
	eigensolutions of the induced second-order Dirac equation system of the 
	hydrogen atom, and draw several unusual conclusions. The exact solution of 
	the first-order induced Dirac equation system of hydrogen atom satisfies the 
	induced second-order Dirac equation, but the complexity of correlation 
	checking increases with the increase of the radial quantum number, and even 
	the checking process of energy states with small radial quantum numbers is 
	very complicated; The induced second-order Dirac equation of hydrogen atom 
	has an eigensolution, and its energy eigenvalue is the same as that of the 
	induced first-order Dirac equation; Different from the constraint of the 
	coefficients of the two wave function components of the first-order Dirac 
	equation system, the exact solutions of the two induced second-order 
	equations are independent of each other, which means that the coefficients 
	of the two component functions have their own normalized coefficients. The 
	independence of the component function of the second order equation poses a 
	new challenge to the physical meaning of the multi-component wave function 
	of Dirac theory.<br>

	<strong>14. The End of Isomeric Second Order Dirac Hydrogen Equations</strong></a></h2>
  <p>Biedenharn and Wong wrote the Dirac equation in the form that the 
	combination of the differential term and the function term is equal to zero, 
	then changed the positive and negative sign of the mass term and removed the 
	wave function to extract a mixing operator, and then used this mixing 
	operator to act on the first-order Dirac equation. The resulting 
	second-order equation is called the isomeric second-order Dirac equation. 
	Because the equations in mathematical sense can be constructed arbitrarily, 
	the isomeric second-order Dirac equation can exist as a pure differential 
	equation. However, as the wave equation of quantum mechanics, the isomeric 
	second-order Dirac equation advocated by famous journals seriously lacks 
	scientific basis and destroys mathematical principles, and the processing of 
	isomeric second-order Dirac equation is completely false calculation. Here, 
	the real heterogeneous second-order Dirac equation is first derived, and it 
	is proved that it is a system of equations composed of four non-solvable 
	second-order partial differential equations of four wave function 
	components. Then it is proved that the highly respected second-order Dirac 
	equation of single-component wave function isomerism is forged, and the 
	Dirac energy level formula of hydrogen atom pieced together is only a prop 
	to cover up the above lies. Then it is proved that the most ideal isomeric 
	second-order radial Dirac equation of hydrogen atom is also an unsolvable 
	differential equation system composed of at least two partial differential 
	equations, which further illustrates the fraud of the highly respected 
	isomeric second-order Dirac equation of single-component wave function. 
	Finally, it is proved that the mixed operator method for constructing the 
	isomeric second-order Dirac equation destroys the unitary principle and 
	leads to many confused and uncertain conclusions. The results of these 
	rigorous calculations declare the end of the heterogeneous second-order 
	Dirac equation and the mixed operator method itself used for the 
	construction of heterogeneous wave equations.<br>

	<strong>15. The End of Expected Solution for True Second Order Dirac Equation</strong></a></h2>
  <p>The original Coulomb field radial Dirac equation is essentially a first 
	order differential system of two-component wave functions. The second order 
	differential equation of the original wave function component directly 
	converted from the first order differential equation set is called the true 
	second order Dirac equation. Relativistic quantum mechanics usually ignores 
	the physical meaning of wave function and only focuses on the energy 
	eigenvalue. So, the main expectation of solving the true second order Dirac 
	equation of hydrogen-like atoms is that the Dirac energy level formula is 
	the eigenvalue of the equation. Here I derive two true second order Dirac 
	equations that are mutually independent in form but actually constrained by 
	common energy parameters, and then use the traditional boundary conditions 
	of hydrogen-like atoms to solve the true second order Dirac equation. The 
	conclusion drawn from this is not exactly the same as the traditional 
	understanding. 1) The formal solution of the true second order Dirac 
	equation satisfying the traditional boundary conditions takes the Dirac 
	hydrogen level formula as the energy eigensolution, which seems to meet the 
	expectation; 2) However, when the radial quantum number is 0, regardless of 
	the value of the angular quantum number, the complete expression of the wave 
	function as the exact solution of the equation diverges at the coordinate 
	origin, which does not meet the traditional boundary conditions, which means 
	that the universe is collapsed and does not conform to the fact of the 
	universe structure. From this it is concluded that the Dirac energy level 
	formula is only the formal eigenvalue of the true second order Dirac 
	equation that does not conform to the physical meaning. This announced the 
	end of the expectation of using traditional boundary conditions to solve the 
	true second order Dirac equation to naturally obtain the Dirac energy level 
	formula. This result will promote the re-study of the exact solution of the 
	original Dirac equation.<br>

  <p>In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation is used to describe the 
	bound state system, and the exact solution of the equation needs to be 
	determined by boundary conditions. However, the size of an atomic nucleus is 
	usually not considered, and the boundary condition that the proposed wave 
	function should meet is only a rough form. The rough boundary condition 
	causes the S-state wave function of the exact solution of the Klein-Gordon 
	equation and Dirac equation of the so-called relativistic quantum mechanics 
	describing the bound state of the Coulomb field to diverge at the coordinate 
	origin and makes the hydrogen-like atom with the nuclear charge number Z&gt;137 
	appear unreal virtual energy. The divergence of the wave function means that 
	the probability density of the electron or meson appearing near the nucleus 
	will increase rapidly. What it predicts is the untrue conclusion that the 
	hydrogen-like atom in S-state will collapse rapidly into a neutron-like 
	atom. Considering that the atomic nucleus has a certain radius, the exact 
	boundary conditions that the wave function should satisfy are given here, 
	and then the Dirac equation of hydrogen-like atom is solved again, and a new 
	exact solution without wave function divergence and virtual energy is 
	obtained. Surprisingly, the exact boundary condition makes the angular 
	quantum number naturally regress to the eigenvalue determined by the exact 
	solution of the equation. It has no contribution to the quantized energy, 
	which means that the angular quantum number constructed by Dirac electron 
	theory is denied. Unlike the Dirac energy level formula, the new energy 
	level formula corresponding to the solution of the Dirac equation for the 
	hydrogen-like atom satisfying the exact boundary conditions has no so-called 
	fine structure, and its accuracy is equivalent to the accuracy of the Bohr 
	energy level. The exact boundary condition solution poses a serious 
	challenge to the Dirac relativistic quantum mechanics, which is called the 
	challenging solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom.<br>

  <p>The challenging solution of the Dirac equation of the Coulomb field 
	satisfying exact boundary conditions is further studied. If the Dirac 
	equation is effective, then the intrinsic angle quantum number determined by 
	the exact solution of the equation must be introduced to modify the Dirac 
	equation to make it self-consistent. The solution of the modified Coulomb 
	field Dirac equation satisfying the exact boundary conditions leads to a 
	variety of breakthrough conclusions that overturns the traditional physical 
	thinking. 1) The modified Dirac equation of Coulomb field has a neutron 
	state solution corresponding to the neutron structure, and the binding 
	energy of the neutron has a certain value, while the calculation result of 
	the intrinsic radius written in the accurate boundary condition is 
	equivalent to the size of the atomic nucleus; 2) The energy eigenvalue 
	formula of the modified Coulomb field Dirac equation contains only radial 
	quantum numbers and is independent of the intrinsic angular quantum numbers, 
	where the zero radial quantum number energy level corresponds to the neutron 
	state, and the nonzero radial quantum number energy level corresponds to the 
	atomic state, and the accuracy of each atomic state energy level is 
	equivalent to the Bohr energy level, while the Dirac energy level formula as 
	the expected solution no longer exists; 3) The intrinsic angular quantum 
	number of the modified Coulomb field Dirac equation indirectly negates the 
	Dirac algebra theory that constructs the Dirac angular quantum number beyond 
	the mathematical calculation rules; 4) The neutron state wave function 
	component of the modified Coulomb Dirac equation is the terminated Yukawa 
	potential function, which reflects the physics dilemma that the wave 
	function is wrongly described as a potential function to establish a Yukawa 
	pseudo-scientific theory that can also be infinitely developed and admired 
	by physicists around the world, exposing the false prosperity of modern 
	physics. It is concluded that the Dirac equation of the Coulomb field 
	defined by Dirac algebra is not self-consistent, and the exact boundary 
	condition solution of the modified self-consistent Dirac equation of the 
	angular quantum number regression intrinsic physical quantity negates the 
	Dirac electronic theory of fabricating the energy level formula of the fine 
	structure of the hydrogen atom spectrum, and the microscopic quantum theory 
	urgently needs to find a more reasonable wave equation that describes the 
	fine spectral structure of the hydrogen atom.<br>

	<strong>18. Ground State Solution of Dongfang Modified Dirac Equation</strong></a></h2>
  <p>In order to deal with the mathematical contradiction that the Dirac wave 
	function does not meet the definite solution condition, an effective and 
	reasonable solution is to replace the traditional rough boundary condition 
	with the precise boundary condition in which the nuclear radius is written. 
	The exact solution of the hydrogen-like atom self-consistent Dirac equation 
	satisfying the exact boundary conditions has subversive physical 
	significance. It also shows a new mathematical point of view, that is, the 
	boundary parameters become one of the eigensolutions of the equation, and 
	the solutions of the equation may be completely different due to the slight 
	difference of the boundary conditions. Dongfang modified Dirac hydrogen 
	equation replaces the angular quantum number defined by the illogical Dirac 
	electron theory with the intrinsic angular quantum number determined by the 
	exact solution of the equation. Here I further study of the ground state 
	solution of the modified Dirac equation which satisfies the exact boundary 
	conditions. The results show that the ground state of the modified Dirac 
	equation for hydrogen-like atoms is a triple degenerate state with three 
	intrinsic angular momentum and three intrinsic wave functions; the intrinsic 
	angular momentum of the ground state is neither the angular momentum 
	constructed by the anti-logic of Dirac electron theory nor the angular 
	momentum of Schrödinger equation. The two components of one of the intrinsic 
	wave functions of the ground state are linearly related. The existence of 
	the exact solution of the intrinsic ground state and the essential 
	difference between the intrinsic ground state energy level and the Dirac 
	ground state energy level further illustrate that the angular momentum 
	constructed by the so-called Dirac algebra is not a corollary of scientific 
	logic, and the Dirac equation cannot explain the fine structure of 
	hydrogen-like atoms. It is only one of the most puzzling representatives of 
	modern physics as the basic equation of quantum field theory. However, 
	because Dirac equation contains rich mathematical problems and unique 
	processing technology, it will help the development of mathematical theory 
	to incorporate it into mathematics textbooks as a new mathematical model.<br>

  <p>The angular quantum number and radial momentum operator of Dirac’s electron 
	theory belongs to the formal mathematical definition, rather than the result 
	of standard mathematical calculation. Whether such formal mathematical 
	definition that changes the fundamental nature of physical logic is 
	reasonable or not can be judged according to whether the definitions of the 
	radial momentum operator and angular momentum eigenvalue are consistent with 
	the calculation results of standard mathematics. Selecting a specific 
	physical model can find the exact answer to the problem, which forces us to 
	seriously deal with the similarities and differences between the formal 
	mathematical definition and the standard mathematical calculation results. 
	Here I discuss the one-dimensional Dirac equation model of hydrogen-like 
	atom and give the standard mathematical calculation conclusion: the 
	one-dimensional Dirac equation has four non-equivalent first-order 
	differential equation systems; the four first-order differential equation 
	systems can also be converted into a system of differential equations 
	composed of two second-order differential equations with the same energy 
	parameter. The mathematical process of accurately solving the general 
	solution of the second-order differential equations is beyond the existing 
	mathematical basis. However, it can be proved that the exact solution of the 
	ground state and a specified excited state of the first-order differential 
	equations does not exist, It means that the first-order Dirac differential 
	equations and the corresponding second-order differential equations of the 
	hydrogen-like atom in the one-dimensional case have no energy quantized 
	eigensolutions. The expression of the radial momentum operator here has a 
	clear conclusion that is different from the definition of Dirac electron 
	theory. The one-dimensional Dirac hydrogen equation is actually a special 
	case of zero angular momentum. The specific zero angular momentum is 
	intentionally avoided by Dirac electron theory because its existence exposes 
	the serious non-consistency of the Dirac equation. This proves that a large 
	number of mathematical calculations on the exact solution of the 
	one-dimensional Dirac equation of the hydrogen atom, which is respected by 
	various scientific documents, belong to the spurious calculation of the 
	expected results. The one-dimensional Dirac equation is thus ended.<br>
