    <p>For more than a hundred years, a generation of theoretical physicist 
      has put forward theories that were difficult to distinguish right from 
      wrong in that era, but were essentially wrong, and gained enormous 
      benefits. Erroneous theories have ascended the supreme altar and 
      captured generations of faithful believers. They joined forces with 
      unprecedented strength, vigorously promoted and developed erroneous 
      theories, and gained more benefits and honor. They do their best to 
      safeguard their vested interests, destroy great new discoveries, 
      endlessly fake experimental phenomena, and write numerous myths and 
      conjectures, whitewash fallacies, and even rob and conquer. Human 
      scientific thought is constantly nibbled, academic journals are 
      monopolized, media are manipulated, lies are flying, natural truth is 
      distorted, scientific theory is strangled, academic morality is 
      trampled, and human nature is destroyed. Theoretical physics has 
      gradually become a scientific pretext for greedy people to swagger 
      through the market and become a private tool for maximizing personal 
      interests. People all over the world who pursue the true meaning of 
      science are finally angry. They stood up, broke through the cage of 
      thought, and tore up the veil that covered the ugly soul. At this time, 
      the wind and clouds surged, and the common quantum theory was born. The 
      macroscopic and microscopic quantized descriptions are unified, and the 
      real face of nature is gradually presented. Henceforth, shameless 
      slander will no longer be able to strangle new discoveries to be in the 
      cradle. Theoretical physics will become a public property that reveals 
      the secrets of nature. Great scientific ideas will always be shining 
      like stars in the vast space.<br>

	<strong>1. On the relativity of the speed of light</strong></a></h2>
  <p>Einstein’s assumption of constant speed of light is regarded as a basic 
    principle of modern physics and has a great and far-reaching inﬂuence. However, 
    the nature and scope of application of the constant speed of light hypothesis 
    have not been discussed by relativity theory, which has led to readers’ 
    misunderstanding of relativity, especially special relativity, for more than 100 
    years, and has been deeply rooted. Here I introduce the Dongfang unitary 
    principle, which has a wide application prospect in the logic self-consistency 
    test of mathematics, natural science and social science. Based on this, I 
    propose the complete space-time transformation including the Lorentz 
    transformation, clarify the deﬁnition of relative velocity of light and the 
    conclusion that the relative velocity of light is variable, and further prove 
    that the relative variable light speed is compatible with Einstein’s constant 
    speed of light. The speciﬁc conclusion is that the propagation speed of light in 
    vacuum relative to the observer’s inertial reference frame is always the 
    constant c, but the propagation speed of light relative to any other inertial 
    reference frame which has relative motion with the observer is not equal to the 
    constant c; observing in all inertial frame of reference, the relative velocity 
    of light propagating in the same direction in vacuum is 0, while that of light 
    propagating in the opposite direction is 2c. The essence of Einstein’s constant 
    speed of light is that the speed of light in an isolated reference frame is 
    constant, but the relative speed of light in vacuum is variable. The assumption 
    of constant speed of light in an isolated frame of reference and the inference 
    of relative variable light speed can be derived from each other.<br>

	<strong>2. The Morbid Equation of Quantum Numbers</strong></a></h2>
  <p>The lowest standard of natural science theory is logical self-consistency. 
    Specifically, its method and inference must conform to the Dongfang unitary 
    principle. However, relativity and quantum mechanics, as the basis of modern 
    physics, are not so, and the problems of quantum mechanics are hidden deeper 
    because the substantive mathematical principles of quantum mechanics have not 
    been revealed. The quantum model of valence electron generation orbital 
    penetration of alkali metal elements with unique stable structure is 
    investigated. The electric field outside the atomic kernel is usually expressed 
    by the Coulomb field of the point charge mode, and the composite electric field 
    in atomic kernel can be equivalent to the electric field inside the sphere with 
    uniform charge distribution or other electric fields without divergence point. 
    The exact solutions of two Schrödinger equations for the bound state of the 
    Coulomb field outside the atom and the binding state of the equivalent field 
    inside the atom determine two different quantization energy formulas 
    respectively. Here I show that the atomic kernel surface is the only common zero 
    potential surface that can be selected. When the orbital penetration occurs, the 
    law of conservation of energy requires that the energy level formulas of the two 
    bound states must have corresponding quantum numbers to make them equal. The 
    result leads to an insoluble morbid equation of quantum numbers, indicating that 
    the two quantum states of the valence electron are incompatible. This 
    irreconcilable contradiction shows that the quantized energy of quantum 
    mechanics cannot absolutely satisfy the law of conservation of energy, and 
    quantum theory violates the unitary principle. Further, I list the morbid 
    equations composed of various eigenvalues of the angular momentum of hydrogen 
    atom described by Bohr theory, Schrödinger and Klein-Gordon theory, and Dirac 
    theory, and point out that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the 
    minimum nontrivial angular momentum eigenvalue determined by the angular 
    momentum eigenvalue equation in quantum mechanics and the minimum nontrivial 
    angular momentum eigenvalue of Bohr theory.<br>

	<strong>3. Relativistic Equation Failure for LIGO Signals</strong></a></h2>
  <p>LIGO announced that the detected signal wave with monotonously increasing 
    frequency is the gravitational wave radiated by the merger of spiral binaries, 
    thus confirming the general relativity of basing on the assumption that the 
    speed of light is constant. However, the assumption that the speed of light is 
    constant has not been proved to be universally valid, and there are many ground 
    signals with monotonic frequency increase, which means that the qualitative of 
    LIGO signal is lack of sufficient basis. Only by finding out the precise law of 
    the characteristic physical quantity of LIGO signal and comparing it with the 
    precise law of the characteristic physical quantity of spiral binary 
    gravitational wave, can we judge whether LIGO signal is spiral binary 
    gravitational wave according to the similarity between the signal and the 
    theoretical model. This decisive scientific research process has been 
    intentionally or unintentionally ignored by LIGO. Here I propose a signal wave 
    spectrum analysis method to clarify the real conclusions of numerical 
    calculation and image analysis of GW150914 signal wave. Firstly, numerical 
    calculation results of GW150914 signal wave frequency change rate obey the com 
    quantization law which needs to be accurately described by integers, and there 
    is an irreconcilable difference between the results and the generalized 
    relativistic frequency equation of the gravitational wave. Secondly, the 
    assignment of the frequency and frequency change rate of GW150914 signal wave to 
    the generalized relativistic frequency equation of gravitational wave constructs 
    a non-linear equation group for the mass of wave source, and the computer image 
    solution shows that the equation group has no GW150914 signal wave solution. 
    Thirdly, it is not unique to calculate the chirp mass of the wave source from 
    the different frequencies and change rates of the numerical relativistic 
    waveform of the GW150914 signal wave, and the numerical relativistic waveform of 
    the GW150914 signal wave deviates too far from the original waveform actually. 
    Other LIGO signal waveforms do not have obvious characteristics of gravitational 
    frequency variation of spiral binary stars and lack precise data, so they cannot 
    be used for numerical analysis and image solution. Therefore, LIGO signals 
    represented by GW150914 signal do not support the relativistic gravitational 
    wave frequency equation, and it is not credible to claim that the GW150914 
    signal wave is the gravitational wave of a spiral binary star. However, whether 
    gravitational wave signals from spiral binaries that may be detected in the 
    future follow the same com quantization law? Only the numerical analysis results 
    of detailed observation data can give an accurate answer.<br>

	<strong>4. Dongfang Modified Equations of Molecular Dynamics</strong></a></h2>
  <p>The unitary principle test of the pressure equation of ideal gas gives a 
    negative conclusion, so I systematically revise the basic equation of molecular 
    dynamics. The specific logic and conclusions are as following. The classical 
    molecular dynamics theory established the wrong physical model of uniform motion 
    of molecules under the action of an equivalent constant force, and the classical 
    equations of ideal gas pressure and temperature derived from this model that 
    violates the principle of mechanics is all incorrect. A variety of physical 
    models of molecular interaction in accordance with the mechanical principle is 
    established, and the correct equation of ideal gas pressure is derived 
    consistently. It is proved that the pressure of an ideal gas is equal to the 
    molecular energy per unit volume, and the thermodynamic temperature of an ideal 
    gas is equal to the quotient of molecular average kinetic energy and Boltzmann 
    constant. Various inferences of different models are consistent, so they comply 
    with the unitary principle. Finally, I introduce the problem of the definite 
    solution of the gas molecular rate distribution function that meets the limit 
    condition of the speed of light, and put forward experimental suggestions to 
    verify the theoretical gas temperature correction equation.<br>

	<strong>5. Dongfang Angular Motion Law and Operator Equations</strong></a></h2>
  <p>Quantum mechanics based on Planck hypothesis and statistical interpretation 
    of wave function has achieved great success in describing the discrete law of 
    micro motion. However, the idea of quantum mechanics has not been successfully 
    used to describe the discrete law of macro motion, and the causality implied in 
    the Planck hypothesis and the application scope of the basic principles of 
    quantum mechanics have not been clarified. Here, I first introduce the angular 
    motion law and its application, which seems to be of no special significance as 
    a supplement to the very perfect classical mechanics, but plays an irreplaceable 
    role in testing whether the core mathematical program of quantum mechanics of 
    the operator evolution wave equation meets the unirary principle. Then, the 
    operator evolution wave equations corresponding to the angular motion law are 
    discussed, and the necessity of generalized optimization of differential 
    equations are illustrated by the form of ordinary differential equations. 
    Finally, the real wave equation which is superior to the Schrödinger equation in 
    physical meaning but not necessarily the ultimate answer is briefly introduced. 
    The implicit conclusion is that Hamiltonian cannot be the only inevitable choice 
    of constructing wave equation in quantum mechanics, and there is no causal 
    relationship between operator evolution wave equation and quantized energy in 
    bound state system, which indicates that whether the essence of quantum 
    mechanics can be completely revealed is the key step to unify macro and micro 
    quantized theory.<br>

  <p>The signal waveform with monotonic frequency change detected by LIGO is implying 
    the discrete law of macroscopic quantization. Here, I accurately analyzed the 
    observation data of GW150914 signal and proved that the Livingston waveform of 
    positive and negative strain reversal was 7.324218ms ahead of Hanford waveform. 
    Then, the time of the positive and negative strain peaks of the main vibration 
    part is corrected by using the superposition waveform, and the numerical results 
    of the discrete frequency of GW150914 signal are calculated. Finally, a 
    numerical analysis method using the minimum digit rational number solution of 
    the characteristic Diophantine equation system was introduced to fit the 
    quantized Lagrange frequency change rate and frequency jump rate of the GW150914 
    signal, providing a quantitative basis for inferring accurate information of the 
    wave source.<br>

	<strong>7. Com Quantum Proof of LIGO Binary Mergers Failure</strong></a></h2>
  <p>LIGO claims to have detected a large number of ancient and distant binary 
    merging gravitational waves. However, only the frequency of GW150914 signal 
    increases significantly and monotonously, showing the expected characteristics 
    of spiral double star merger, but it is highly similar to the engine operating 
    frequency in the starting process of contemporary fighter. LIGO observers should 
    know which is more likely. Other signal waves of LIGO have no research value due 
    to lack of detailed data. Here, I further analyzed the frequency distribution 
    and change law of GW150914 signal, and proved the unreliability of its spiral 
    double black hole merger assertion by fitting the precise recurrence 
    relationship of the frequency of GW150914 waveform with macro quantization 
    significance. The specific process and conclusions are as following. Firstly, 
    the characteristic equation for effectively correcting the amplitude time of the 
    waveform is proposed, the specification conditions for the numerical analysis 
    method of the minimum solution of the characteristic Diophantine equations are 
    determined, the new correction value of the amplitude time of the GW150914 
    waveform is given, and then the quantized recurrence equation characterizing the 
    frequency distribution of the signal is obtained. Then, the complex but clear 
    data processing program for drawing the com quantum theory waveform is 
    introduced, and the standard waveform of GW150914 waveform is drawn. It is 
    pointed out that the drawing of the LIGO numerical relativistic waveform is 
    opaque, and the conclusion is fuzzy and lacks due scientific analysis. Then, the 
    iconic maximum frequency of the merger event of GW150914 signal wave source 
    supposed to be a spiral double star is calculated, and it is confirmed that this 
    characteristic frequency is missing in the GW150914 waveform. The reason why 
    neither Hanford waveform nor Livingston waveform has the corresponding 
    characteristic frequency band is further analyzed, which proves that the merger 
    of the GW150914 spiral double black holes of LIGO is not successful, It means 
    that the LIGO signal is far more likely to be the signal of the start-up of 
    modern fighter on the ground than the gravitational wave of the merger of 
    ancient and far away spiral binaries. Finally, an experimental proposal for 
    detecting the gravitational wave of the simulated spiral double star system is 
    proposed to effectively test the confidence of the laser interference 
    gravitational wave detector.<br>

  <p>Systematically show the correct solution process of the initial value problem of 
    Maxwell equations in rectangular coordinate system and cylindrical coordinate 
    system, and clearly point out that the transverse electromagnetic wave equation 
    described in the classical electromagnetic theory is the result of incorrect 
    understanding and treatment of Maxwell equations: the definite solution 
    conditions of magnetic field and electric field in the same phase that do not 
    conform to the natural law are assumed in advance, and then the plane transverse 
    electromagnetic wave mode is determined through the general solutions of the 
    second-order Maxwell equations, and the conclusion violates the law of energy 
    conservation, In particular, the mathematical process does not conform to the 
    solving rules of differential equations. Through this simple example, I clarify 
    my clear position: since the era of Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, 
    theoretical physics has fallen into a strange circle in which the wrong 
    calculation of celebrities is defined as standard methods and the assumption 
    that celebrities cannot prove is defined as basic principles, resulting in a 
    large number of wrong logic and wrong conclusions in physical theory, even some 
    branches of theoretical physics are completely wrong from beginning to end, and 
    all these errors are covered up by formal mathematical operations, the formal 
    mathematics seriously distorts the laws of nature. However, all correctable and 
    uncorrectable errors have not been found and recognized by mainstream 
    physicists, and especially the pointing out of these errors has been rejected by 
    mainstream scholars. A serious question arises: Can the future mainstream

    mesons as its experimental test, which is farfetched. It goes without saying 
    that there are no mesons in nuclei such as deuterons. However, it is the lack of 
    scientific basis to construct the wave equation by using the quantum mechanical 
    operator to act on the unknown function, so as to piece up the exact solution of 
    the potential function. The relevant calculation results do not form an 
    inevitable causal relationship with the existence of mesons. Even if a celebrity 
    patchwork theory is maintained, meson theory should have at least one observable 
    quantitative inference from the perspective of experimental test theory. Here, 
    the ground state energy corresponding to the Yukawa potential expressed by the 
    nuclear force constant and the mass of the PI meson is calculated by the 
    variational method, and then the average binding energy of the atomic nucleus is 
    connected with the ground state energy corresponding to the Yukawa potential to 
    calculate the average nuclear force constant. From this result, it is estimated 
    that the distribution range of the average nuclear force constant of 118 atomic 
    nuclei in the periodic table of elements is from 1.093992 to 1.413981. The 
    results also show that the estimated value of nuclear force constant up to 15 is 
    unreliable. However, the nuclear force constant cannot be predicted by other 
    methods. Calculating the average nuclear force constant by using the ground 
    state energy corresponding to Yukawa potential is only a dead cycle, and the 
    desire to test meson theory through experimental observation cannot be realized. 
    This unexpected result shows that modern physical theory has long fallen into an 
    unrealistically strange circle of formal logic shrouded in the halo of 
    mathematics: although the conditions and conclusions of the theory are far from 
    the true description of natural phenomena, the theory can be deduced infinitely, 
    and is constantly beautified and advocated as a profound revelation of natural 
    laws. The reason why this paper introduces the average nuclear force constant 
    mapped by the unreasonable Yukawa potential is to disclose some unique 
    calculation methods that need to be applied in establishing a reasonable nuclear 
    force model in the future.<br>

	<strong>10. The End of Yukawa Meson Theory of Nuclear Forces</strong></a></h2>
  <p>Yukawa meson theory of nuclear force originates from the fiction of Yukawa 
    potential function which distorts mathematics. Its logical essence is to 
    dismember the physical equation to fabricate a potential function, endow the 
    mass factor in the fictional potential function with the meaning of meson mass, 
    and then claim that the nucleon in the nucleus depends on the meson to exchange 
    force, so there is a meson theory of nuclear force. However, there has never 
    been a meson in the nucleus. It is obviously unreasonable to say that the 
    interaction between nucleons is dominated by other substances that are not in 
    the nucleus. Here I have reviewed Yukawa’s paper on the creation of the nuclear 
    meson theory in detail, and strictly pointed out that the serious distortion of 
    the basic mathematical algorithm in the process of fabricating Yukawa potential 
    function is irreparable, and there is no scientific logic and experimental basis 
    to prove that the mass factor in Yukawa potential function is a meson. 
    Specifically: 1) The Yukawa meson theory introduces a delta function without 
    causality into the operator equation of relativistic momentum energy 
    relationship, thus very covertly deleting the energy term, which essentially 
    belongs to tearing and dismembering the operator equation corresponding to the 
    relativistic momentum energy relationship, seriously distorting the basic 
    mathematical algorithms and physical logic; 2) Yukawa’s paper tore and 
    dismembered the relativistic momentum energy operator equation to give a 
    mutilated equation that meets the expectation but has no physical significance 
    in practice, and then introduced the unrelated Compton wavelength to knead, 
    interpreted the mass factor in the exponential factor of the exact solution of 
    the defective equation as the mass of mesons that do not exist in the atomic 
    nucleus, and declared that mesons are the medium of nucleon interaction, the 
    nuclear meson theory thus created is anti-scientific logic; 3) The stationary 
    solution of the operator equation of the momentum energy relationship of free 
    particles is Bessel function, but the Yukawa meson theory deletes the energy 
    operator in the operator equation of the momentum energy relationship and then 
    solves the mutilated equation, which is equivalent to strongly twisting Bessel 
    function into an exponential function that meets the expectation, which is a 
    severe distortion of the basic mathematical algorithm; 4) The calculation 
    results of the binding energy of the atomic nucleus show that the nucleus cannot 
    absorb other particles such as mesons when nucleons combine into the atomic 
    nucleus, while Yukawa’s meson theory insists that mesons are the medium of 
    interaction between nucleons, which is just the hegemonic fallacy. All these 
    facts mean that the Yukawa meson theory, which is based on distorting the basic 
    mathematical algorithms and fabricating potential functions, is a 
    pseudo-scientific theory and must be completely terminated.<br>
