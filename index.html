<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #525050; ">
The concept of logical entropy is explained, and the logical entropy principle, which is generally applicable to locating logical loopholes in mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences, is introduced. The Euler infinite descent method of the cubic Fermat's last conjecture is optimized, and the logical loopholes hidden in Euler's theory due to the change of logical entropy are revealed based on the logical entropy principle. Then two strict statements of the Euler cubic infinite descent method of the cubic Fermat's last conjecture are given to clarify its accurate scope of application. The incomplete quaternion of the spherical Diophantine equation is further constructed, so as to specifically illustrate that the logical entropy change of the solution of the Diophantine equation is accompanied by logical loopholes. It is concluded that the logical entropy change of the Euler infinite descent method leads to logical loopholes, and the possible causal relationship is described as the necessary causal relationship, which actually fails to complete the proof of the cubic Fermat's last conjecture.

<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #525050; ">
Euler's infinite descent proof of the conjecture that the cubic Fermat equation has no integer solutions has been influential in the field for nearly three hundred years. However, the logical entropy principle analysis indicates certain limitations in Euler's approach. Further research suggests that Euler's proof addresses a specific case among several possible scenarios. The proposed logical entropy framework provides alternative perspectives on this classical problem regarding the cubic Fermat's Last Theorem.

<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #525050; ">
It is clarified that the decisive factors in the elementary proof of Fermat's last theorem are the complex division problems and the very poor perfect power theory, and proven that the Fermat equation with sufficient powers only has the trivial integer solution where one of the numbers must be zero, and expanded that the elementary algebraic method of independently deriving the Pythagoras triple array and independently proving Fermat's last theorem with powers of 3 and 4 respectively during my college days in the summer of 1984. By establishing the equivalent nonlinear Diophantine equation of the Fermat equation with odd prime numbers satisfying the condition of having non trivial integer solutions, and proving that the most probable solution of the sufficient and necessary condition group of the equivalent nonlinear Diophantine equation leads to only complex solutions of the equivalent nonlinear equation, so it is proved in the scope of elementary algebra that the Fermat equation does not have non trivial integer solutions. From Pythagorean triple to Fermat's Last Theorem, the systematic elementary algebraic proofs that conform to the meaning of mathematical induction are impressive and even readers who are not enthusiastic about Diophantine equations can independently understand and master them with only secondary school mathematical knowledge. The elementary algebraic method reveals the obvious contradiction that the integer solution condition of the Fermat equation with a prime power of 3 leads to a perfect power equal to the prime number. The proof of this special Fermat's last theorem is concise and clever. However, the proof of Fermat's theorem for any prime power not less than 5 requires sufficient space and cannot be completed in one go. It can be inferred from this that Fermat's statement that he could not write clever proofs in the blank spaces of the book at that time may be due to the systematic nature of elementary algebraic methods, which leads to an illusion that the proofs for all odd prime power cases are exactly the same as those for power 3 cases.

<div> <h2>About</h2>
<p>
Mathematics & Nature is an independent scientific journal that documents significant scientific ideas which have received limited attention in conventional publications. While current academic systems may not fully recognize these contributions, the innovative concepts presented here represent important advances in mathematical understanding. The journal aims to promote rigorous scientific inquiry and the free exchange of ideas that can inspire future research.
</p>
</div>	
<div><h2>ReadMe</h2>
<p>
Readers often require authors to publish papers in mainstream journals. However, influential mainstream journals traditionally favoring established researchers have historically overlooked breakthrough discoveries by lesser-known scholars. Documented cases exist where key elements of innovative manuscripts appeared elsewhere prior to original authors' preprint publication, raising questions about editorial practices. These circumstances have necessitated independent platforms like Mathematics &amp; Nature for disseminating novel findings.
﻿
Mathematics &amp; Nature serves as an independent venue for significant mathematical and scientific advances that challenge conventional paradigms. The journal will publish 100 studies re-examining foundational theories, including critical analyses of certain award-recognized works. Historical patterns indicate that Nobel selections have occasionally privileged theoretical frameworks later subject to substantive debate regarding their mathematical consistency and empirical support. This journal seeks to foster rigorous re-evaluation of such foundational scientific claims.

<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #7E19CB; ">
The unitary principle, which is widely applicable to the test of mathematical logic, natural science logic and social science logic, is elaborated. The traditional associated Legendre spherical harmonic function with spherical symmetry satisfying the condition of function boundedness has been extended to a general associated Legendre spherical harmonic function that includes non spherically symmetric unbounded functions. Furthermore, two types of special entangled spherical harmonic functions have been extended to include both bounded functions with spherical symmetry and non spherically symmetric unbounded functions. The linear combination of three kinds of generalized spherical harmonics constitutes the integrated generalized entangled spherical harmonics as the general solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations.

The results clearly show that the traditional theory of solving partial differential equations leads to incomplete exact solutions, and the given solutions of spherical harmonic partial differential equations and related wave equations show substantial deviations. The undetermined integral coefficients contained in the integrated general entangled spherical harmonic function increase with the increase of the redefined periodic quantum number.

Based on the basic principles of general and specific solutions of differential equations, even if the function is required to satisfy bounded conditions, there is no specific form for the complete set of spherical harmonic functions that represent the general solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations. This conclusion necessitates reconsideration of the traditional theory of determining the specific solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations using normalization conditions.

From this, the solution non-uniqueness principle of partial differential equations is summarized, and the observation variability principle for experimental tests of quantitative inference in natural sciences is proposed. Current research indicates that both physical theories based on the characteristic solutions of spherical harmonic partial differential equations and certain other partial differential equations, and experimental reports testing their physical interpretations, require careful re-examination, suggesting significant potential for theoretical development.
