<div> <h2>About</h2>
<p>Mathematics &amp; Nature, the new type of scientific journal, bears the historical responsibility of recording those great scientific ideas shamelessly stifled, defamed, and even plagiarized by so-called reputable and influential mainstream scientific journals. These great scientific ideas will undoubtedly lead the future scientific community.</p>
</div>	
<div><h2>ReadMe</h2>
<p>Readers often require authors to publish papers in mainstream journals. But the reality is that influential mainstream journals with the highest responsibility of publishing articles on celebrity lies and maintaining the fame and fortune of lying celebrities have never and will never introduce significant breakthrough discoveries by non-famous scholars that far exceed their own. Even some well-known mainstream academic websites often allow original authors to publish their articles in preprint form only after some key content of breakthrough paper manuscripts by non-renowned scholars has been plagiarized, hypocritically demonstrating the fairness and justice advocated by preprint server controllers. Discoverers seeking truth therefore have to create self-media journals, break through the crazy blockade and strangulation of fame and fortune mainstream, and spread great scientific truths to the world with tenacious perseverance. Mathematics and Nature is one of the self-media journals that emerged in this historical context. Readers will be able to read about a series of significant breakthroughs in mathematics and science that powerful mainstream academic groups cannot achieve in more time from Mathematics and Nature. Insight into the motives and outcomes of mainstream scholars who have been stifling and defaming major breakthrough discoveries, recognize the ignorance, arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and immorality of mainstream scholars, and see through the ugly face hidden under the glamorous veil of mainstream scholars. The journal Mathematics and Nature plans to publish 100 major breakthrough papers, introducing unparalleled scientific discoveries since Newton, exposing the essence of the erroneous and absurd theories packaged by the magnificent Nobel Medal based on false mathematical calculations and fabricated observational data in experimental reports. For nearly 100 years, the Nobel Prize jury has been intentionally, unintentionally, or controlled by power, constantly awarding medals and bonuses to erroneous theories and false experimental reports that they do not understand at all. They have turned ignorant and immoral individuals into heroes in the scientific community, making them shining lighthouses in the boundless ocean of science. The actual effect is to guide scientific research towards lies and fraud. Mathematics and Nature, with its weak power, strives to promote scientific righteousness and alert future moral individuals to participate in the leadership work of the scientific community. People all over the world who pursue truth unite and strive to realize our common great wish.</p>

<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #7E19CB; ">The unitary principle, which is widely applicable to the test of mathematical logic, natural science logic and social science logic, is elaborated. The traditional associated Legendre spherical harmonic function with spherical symmetry satisfying the condition of function boundedness has been extended to a general associated Legendre spherical harmonic function that includes non spherically symmetric unbounded functions. Furthermore, two types of special entangled spherical harmonic functions have been extended to include both bounded functions with spherical symmetry and non spherically symmetric unbounded functions. The linear combination of three kinds of generalized spherical harmonics constitutes the integrated generalized entangled spherical harmonics as the general solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations. The results clearly show that the traditional theory of solving partial differential equations leads to the serious lack of exact solutions, and the given solutions of spherical harmonic partial differential equations and related wave equations are seriously distorted. The undetermined integral coefficients contained in the integrated general entangled spherical harmonic function increase with the increase of the redefined periodic quantum number. Based on the basic principles of general and specific solutions of differential equations, even if the function is required to satisfy bounded conditions, there is no specific form for the complete set of spherical harmonic functions that represent the general solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations. This conclusion overturns the traditional theory of determining the specific solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations using normalization conditions. From this, the uncertain principle of special solution of partial differential equations is summarized, and the uncertain principle of observation for experimental tests of quantitative inference in natural sciences is proposed, so as to avoid wasting time and effort on complex refutation of all claims of obtaining so-called experimental tests based on conclusions that are essentially miscalculations. So far, even the most conservative mathematicians and scientists have had to face up to the fact that both physical theories based on the characteristic solutions of spherical harmonic partial differential equations and certain other partial differential equations, and experimental reports testing the inferences that partial differential equations describe physical phenomena, are being challenged, and that mathematics and natural sciences will usher in a new period of great prosperity. </div>
