<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #525050; ">Firstly, the concept of logical entropy was elaborated, and the principle of logical entropy change, which is universally applicable for identifying logical loopholes in mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences, was introduced. Optimized the proof process of Euler's infinite descent method for Fermat's Last Theorem with a power of 3, and revealed hidden and difficult to repair logical loopholes based on the principle of logical entropy change. This means that before the emergence of new elementary proofs, Fermat's Last Theorem with a power of 3 has not actually been rigorously proven in the field of elementary mathematics. Then, two typical examples were given to support the conclusion that some solutions of the nonlinear Diophantine equation have decreased confidence in logical inference due to changes in logical entropy.</div>

<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #525050; ">
It is clarified that the decisive factors in the elementary proof of Fermat's last theorem are the complex division problems and the very poor perfect power theory, and proven that the Fermat equation with sufficient powers only has the trivial integer solution where one of the numbers must be zero, and expanded that the elementary algebraic method of independently deriving the Pythagoras triple array and independently proving Fermat's last theorem with powers of 3 and 4 respectively during my college days in the summer of 1984. By establishing the equivalent nonlinear Diophantine equation of the Fermat equation with odd prime numbers satisfying the condition of having non trivial integer solutions, and proving that the most probable solution of the sufficient and necessary condition group of the equivalent nonlinear Diophantine equation leads to only complex solutions of the equivalent nonlinear equation, so it is proved in the scope of elementary algebra that the Fermat equation does not have non trivial integer solutions. From Pythagorean triple to Fermat's Last Theorem, the systematic elementary algebraic proofs that conform to the meaning of mathematical induction are impressive and even readers who are not enthusiastic about Diophantine equations can independently understand and master them with only secondary school mathematical knowledge. The elementary algebraic method reveals the obvious contradiction that the integer solution condition of the Fermat equation with a prime power of 3 leads to a perfect power equal to the prime number. The proof of this special Fermat's last theorem is concise and clever. However, the proof of Fermat's theorem for any prime power not less than 5 requires sufficient space and cannot be completed in one go. It can be inferred from this that Fermat's statement that he could not write clever proofs in the blank spaces of the book at that time may be due to the systematic nature of elementary algebraic methods, which leads to an illusion that the proofs for all odd prime power cases are exactly the same as those for power 3 cases.

<div> <h2>About</h2>
<p>Mathematics &amp; Nature, the new type of scientific journal, bears the historical responsibility of recording those great scientific ideas shamelessly stifled, defamed, and even plagiarized by so-called reputable and influential mainstream scientific journals. Even though mainstream scholars who always prioritize personal fame and fortune over scientific truth will continue to suppress and defame them for a long time, these great scientific ideas, based on the highest wisdom, stand at the top of the unchallenged world and will undoubtedly lead the scientific world for thousands of years in the future.</p>
</div>	
<div><h2>ReadMe</h2>
<p>Readers often require authors to publish papers in mainstream journals. But the reality is that influential mainstream journals with the highest responsibility of publishing articles on celebrity lies and maintaining the fame and fortune of lying celebrities have never and will never introduce significant breakthrough discoveries by non-famous scholars that far exceed their own. Even some well-known mainstream academic websites often allow original authors to publish their articles in preprint form only after some key content of breakthrough paper manuscripts by non-renowned scholars has been plagiarized, hypocritically demonstrating the fairness and justice advocated by preprint server controllers. Discoverers seeking truth therefore have to create self-media journals, break through the crazy blockade and strangulation of fame and fortune mainstream, and spread great scientific truths to the world with tenacious perseverance. Mathematics and Nature is one of the self-media journals that emerged in this historical context. Readers will be able to read about a series of significant breakthroughs in mathematics and science that powerful mainstream academic groups cannot achieve in more time from Mathematics and Nature. Insight into the motives and outcomes of mainstream scholars who have been stifling and defaming major breakthrough discoveries, recognize the ignorance, arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and immorality of mainstream scholars, and see through the ugly face hidden under the glamorous veil of mainstream scholars. The journal Mathematics and Nature plans to publish 100 major breakthrough papers, introducing unparalleled scientific discoveries since Newton, exposing the essence of the erroneous and absurd theories packaged by the magnificent Nobel Medal based on false mathematical calculations and fabricated observational data in experimental reports. For nearly 100 years, the Nobel Prize jury has been intentionally, unintentionally, or controlled by power, constantly awarding medals and bonuses to erroneous theories and false experimental reports that they do not understand at all. They have turned ignorant and immoral individuals into heroes in the scientific community, making them shining lighthouses in the boundless ocean of science. The actual effect is to guide scientific research towards lies and fraud. Mathematics and Nature, with its weak power, strives to promote scientific righteousness and alert future moral individuals to participate in the leadership work of the scientific community. People all over the world who pursue truth unite and strive to realize our common great wish.</p>

The unitary principle, which is widely applicable to the test of mathematical logic, natural science logic and social science logic, is elaborated. The traditional associated Legendre spherical harmonic function with spherical symmetry satisfying the condition of function boundedness has been extended to a general associated Legendre spherical harmonic function that includes non spherically symmetric unbounded functions. Furthermore, two types of special entangled spherical harmonic functions have been extended to include both bounded functions with spherical symmetry and non spherically symmetric unbounded functions. The linear combination of three kinds of generalized spherical harmonics constitutes the integrated generalized entangled spherical harmonics as the general solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations. The results clearly show that the traditional theory of solving partial differential equations leads to the serious lack of exact solutions, and the given solutions of spherical harmonic partial differential equations and related wave equations are seriously distorted. The undetermined integral coefficients contained in the integrated general entangled spherical harmonic function increase with the increase of the redefined periodic quantum number. Based on the basic principles of general and specific solutions of differential equations, even if the function is required to satisfy bounded conditions, there is no specific form for the complete set of spherical harmonic functions that represent the general solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations. This conclusion overturns the traditional theory of determining the specific solution of spherical harmonic partial differential equations using normalization conditions. From this, the uncertain principle of special solution of partial differential equations is summarized, and the uncertain principle of observation for experimental tests of quantitative inference in natural sciences is proposed, so as to avoid wasting time and effort on complex refutation of all claims of obtaining so-called experimental tests based on conclusions that are essentially miscalculations. So far, even the most conservative mathematicians and scientists have had to face up to the fact that both physical theories based on the characteristic solutions of spherical harmonic partial differential equations and certain other partial differential equations, and experimental reports testing the inferences that partial differential equations describe physical phenomena, are being challenged, and that mathematics and natural sciences will usher in a new period of great prosperity.

Mathematics &amp; Nature focuses on publishing XD Dongfang's unparalleled breakthrough papers in the fields of mathematics and natural sciences, and timely reporting on XD Dongfang's latest research. XD Dongfang's theory is vast and profound, with rigorous and complex logic. His numerous papers are unprecedented in terms of rare originality, unique structure, rigorous layout, and artistic description, which increase the difficulty of plagiarism and preemptive publication that is common in mainstream academic circles. A few people attempted to use artificial intelligence to steal XD Dongfang's significant breakthrough research results but failed. They turned to personal attacks, followed XD Dongfang for many years, framed XD Dongfang anonymously on the Internet, maliciously confused right and wrong, reversed black and white, and slandered XD Dongfang for academic misconduct. People who pursue scientific truth and love scientific truth strongly condemn the dirty and shameless behavior of plagiarists, and have extreme contempt for their extremely despicable human nature.
